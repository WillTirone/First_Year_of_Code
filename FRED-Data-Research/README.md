# FRED-Data-Research
Creating a project to work with some FRED Data and learn pandas

Data is pulled through Quandl / FRED 

The three metrics I used are: 
  1. Nominal rate of unemployment -Thousands of Persons Seasonally Adjusted, Persons 16 years of age and older. 
  2. GDP - Gross Domestic Product in billions of $USD (Fed's calculation method: http://www.bea.gov/national/pdf/nipaguid.pdf)
  3. New Privately Owned Housing Units Started (Thousands of Units Seasonally Adjusted Annual Rate) - the number of new housing units that
  began construction

For the sake of showing progress, I've kept the old .py file that I started with initially; I've since learned quite a bit and have instead opted to use Jupyter Notebook since there's some visualization involved.
