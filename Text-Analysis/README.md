# Text-Analysis
A project to iterate through .txt documents to find info we want

This is based on a text program from Dr. Allen Downey in Think Python 2e. I thought it was pretty neat, so I'm adapting it to add some additional functionality

I'm also learning Git as part of this project, so if you see any absurd commits or changes that don't make any sense, that's why!
